# 🎮 Platformer Game - Learn Intermediate OOP

This repository contains a **browser-based 2D platformer game** built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It is designed as a learning project to explore **intermediate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** while building an interactive game.

## 🚀 Features
- **Start Screen**: Instructions and a start button to launch the game.  
- **Player Movement**:  
  - Move left and right using **arrow keys**.  
  - Jump using **spacebar** or the **up arrow**.  
- **Gravity Simulation**: Smooth falling and landing mechanics.  
- **Platforms**: Multiple levels of platforms for navigation.  
- **Checkpoints**:  
  - Progress through **yellow checkpoints** to advance.  
  - Displays a congratulatory message upon reaching the final checkpoint.  
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Game structure and canvas rendering.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, layouts, and responsive UI.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic, OOP implementation, and animations.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` → Main entry point with start and checkpoint screens.  
- `styles.css` → Game styling and responsive layout.  
- `script.js` → Game mechanics, OOP classes (`Player`, `Platform`, `CheckPoint`), and rendering logic.  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Applying **OOP principles** in JavaScript (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation).  
- Handling **keyboard events** for interactivity.  
- Implementing **game physics** such as gravity and collision detection.  
- Creating a **scalable game loop** with `requestAnimationFrame`.
